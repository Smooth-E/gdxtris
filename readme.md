## What is GdxTris
GdxTris is a game made according to the Tetris [Guidlines](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline) and inspired by [JSTris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/). It is a game where you compete with other players, cinnected to the same local network.
## How do I play&
In order to play, you and your opponents have to connect to the same local network (network dont need to have an internet acces ^.^).

Next up, one of the players should tap on HOST in game's main menu. They will create a room on their device. Then they have to tap on the question mark button, here they can see their local ip address, which they have to provide to other players in order for them to connect.

Other players then have to input host's ip address into the room ip field and then tap on connect. If everything went okay, you all will be connected to the host and be ready to play. Ask the host to start the game and compete!
## Game mechanics
Clear the lines to gain points. Scoring goes as it is described in [guidlines](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline). When the game starts, it assigns a "victim" for every player in the room. So every participant acts as an attacker for someone and as a victim for someone at once. When you clear any amount of lines, this amount gets sent to your victims pocket (4-line clear however sents 8 lines of garbage to your opponent). If you are not performing any line clears in a certain amount of time, your victim's pocket gets empty and the amount of lines which was there gets sent to player's field as some garbage lines. Perform line clears faster and more efficient than your opponents to beat them!
## Other features
You can change app's color theme by tapping the brush icon in main menu.

You can change your username that will be shown to other players (from main menu also).
